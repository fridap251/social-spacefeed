# Technology Stack and Component Breakdown

This document details the technology stack for the Social Spacefeed MVP.

## Component Breakdown & Technology Choices

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Real-time Data Ingestion** | **Node.js with Socket.IO or RabbitMQ** | Node.js is excellent for handling real-time data streams. Socket.IO is a simple choice for WebSocket-based communication. RabbitMQ offers more robust message queuing for future scalability. |
| **AI Summarizer** | **Python with Hugging Face Transformers** | Python is the de-facto language for AI/ML. The Hugging Face library provides easy access to state-of-the-art language models that we can fine-tune for our specific use case. We can start with a pre-trained model like GPT-2 or a smaller, more efficient model. |
| **Social Feed Service (Backend)** | **Node.js with Express.js or a Python framework (FastAPI/Django)** | Node.js/Express is a popular and lightweight choice for building APIs. FastAPI (Python) is another excellent option, known for its high performance and automatic API documentation. |
| **Database** | **MongoDB or PostgreSQL** | MongoDB (NoSQL) is flexible and scales easily, which is great for a social feed where the data structure might evolve. PostgreSQL (SQL) offers more structured data and powerful querying capabilities. The choice depends on how structured we want our data to be. For an MVP, MongoDB's flexibility is often an advantage. |
| **Frontend Application** | **React (with Next.js) or Vue.js (with Nuxt.js)** | React and Vue are the two most popular frontend frameworks. Using a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js provides benefits like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which are great for performance and SEO. |
| **Deployment** | **Docker & Docker Compose** | Containerizing our services with Docker will make them portable and easy to deploy consistently across different environments. Docker Compose will allow us to define and run our multi-container application with a single command. |

## Recommended Stack for MVP

For the MVP, I recommend the following stack to ensure a balance of development speed, performance, and scalability:

-   **Ingestion Service:** Node.js with Socket.IO
-   **AI Summarizer:** Python with Hugging Face (using a pre-trained model)
-   **Backend API:** Node.js with Express.js
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Frontend:** React with Next.js
-   **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose

This stack uses JavaScript/TypeScript across the full stack (except for the Python-based AI service), which can simplify development.
