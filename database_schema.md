# Database Schema (MongoDB)

This document outlines the MongoDB database schema for the Social Spacefeed MVP.

## Collections

We will use two main collections: `posts` and `users`.

### `posts` Collection

This collection stores the posts that appear in the social feed.

**Document Structure:**

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "content": "String",
  "timestamp": "Date",
  "likes": "Number",
  "comments": [
    {
      "_id": "ObjectId",
      "author": "ObjectId", // Reference to the 'users' collection
      "text": "String",
      "timestamp": "Date"
    }
  ]
}
```

-   **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the post.
-   **`content`**: The plain-language summary generated by the AI.
-   **`timestamp`**: The time the post was created.
-   **`likes`**: A count of the number of likes the post has received.
-   **`comments`**: An array of comment sub-documents.
    -   **`author`**: A reference to the user who wrote the comment.
    -   **`text`**: The content of the comment.
    -   **`timestamp`**: The time the comment was created.

### `users` Collection

This collection stores information about the users of the application. For the MVP, this can be very simple.

**Document Structure:**

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "username": "String", // A unique username
  "createdAt": "Date"
}
```

-   **`_id`**: The unique identifier for the user.
-   **`username`**: The user's chosen username.
-   **`createdAt`**: The timestamp of when the user account was created.

## Relationships

-   The `posts.comments.author` field will reference the `_id` of a document in the `users` collection. This allows us to easily retrieve user information for a given comment.

This schema is designed to be simple and efficient for the MVP's requirements. We can easily add more fields as the application grows.
